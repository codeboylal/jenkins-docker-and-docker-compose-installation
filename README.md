# Repository Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the installation script:

## Clone the Repository

\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/codeboylal/jenkins-docker-and-docker-compose-installation-script.git
\`\`\`

## Navigate to the Script Directory

\`\`\`bash
cd jenkins-docker-and-docker-compose-installation-script
\`\`\`

## Make the Script Executable

\`\`\`bash
chmod +x jenkins-docker-and-docker-compose-installation-script.sh
\`\`\`

## Run the Installation Script

\`\`\`bash
./jenkins-docker-and-docker-compose-installation-script.sh
\`\`\`

This will start the installation process and configure docker, docker-compose and jenkins and also adds jenkins and user to the docker group. 
So, just run the script and chill!

Happy installing!
